# Power-BI-Projects
In this Projects, I will be implementing complete Microsoft Power BI Projects end to end. Right from requirement gathering to publishing the report. We will be importing the data from CSV files, and then cleaning and transforming the data as required. After that, we will apply various DAX & Calculated column calculations to compute our requirements. After that, we will focus on UI enhancement to make it more readable.
Concepts covered:

Data Gathering
Data Cleaning
Data Modelling & [Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema]
DAX Calculation
Row-Level Security (RLS)
User Interface (UI Enhancement)
Calculated Columns
Working on Power Query
